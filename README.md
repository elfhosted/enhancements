# Elf Enhancement Proposals (EEPs!)

Welcome, Elfie!

This repo tracks "Elf Enhancement Proposals" (EEPs), which are suggestions for enhancements on the ElfHosted platform, separate from bug reports.

Here's the lifecycle of an EEP:

1. Birth (*via https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/new/choose*)..
2. Maturation (*can it be done, should it be done, how will it be done?*), and assuming it survives maturation..
3. Adulthood (*it's done and in production!*)
